CDAP Integration Tests
======================

Writing Tests
-------------
New test cases should be written in the ``integration-test-remote`` module, alongside the existing test cases.
They can be within their own package, as long as it is a "sub-package" of ``co.cask.cdap.apps``.

When writing an integration test, the same APIs are available as in CDAP unit tests.
Note that some APIs are not available, such as the ``TestManager`` methods ``deployTemplate``, ``addTemplatePlugins``,
and ``getDataset``.

For instance, to compile and deploy an Application class and start a Flow of that application::

  ApplicationManager applicationManager = deployApplication(WordCount.class);
  applicationManager.getFlowManager("WordCounter").start()

If additional APIs are needed that are not available in the CDAP unit tests framework,
the CDAP clients library can be utilized to interact with the CDAP instance.

For instance, example usage of StreamClient is in the StreamTest test class. Other clients can be
instantiated in a similar manner::

  StreamClient streamClient = new StreamClient(getClientConfig(), getRestClient());
  streamClient.create("TestStream");


Running Tests
-------------
To run integration tests against a remote CDAP instance, execute::

  mvn clean test -DinstanceUri=<HostAndPort>

Note that the CDAP instance against which the integration tests are run must have unrecoverable reset enabled.

To run integration tests against an automatically instantiated CDAP Standalone instance, execute::

  mvn clean test -P standalone-test

To modify the timeouts for program start/stop awaiting, set the ``programTimeout`` argument to a number (in seconds).
For instance, to set the timeout to 120 seconds::

  mvn clean test -DinstanceUri=<HostAndPort> -DprogramTimeout=120

To configure the namespace used for the tests, use::

  -Dtest.namespace=<TestNamespace>

To run against a secure cluster with basic authentication, use::

  -Dcdap.username=<username> -Dcdap.password=<password>


CDAP Upgrade Tests
------------------
The upgrade test cases consist of a ``pre`` stage and a ``post`` stage. The pre stage is test code which
is designed to set up the CDAP instance with applications and data. The post stage is then intended to run after
upgrading the CDAP instance to assert that the upgrade was successful.

To run upgrade tests, execute the following steps::

  1. Run the pre stage against an older version of CDAP.
  2. Upgrade the CDAP instance to the newer version.
  3. Run the post stage against an newer version of CDAP.


To run a particular stage, execute the following from the commandline::

  mvn test -P upgrade-test-<stage> -DinstanceUri=<HostAndPort>


CDAP Long Running Tests
------------------
The long running test cases consist of 4 operations, ``setup``, ``cleanup``, ``verifyRuns`` and ``runOperations``.
More information on design of long running tests can be found [here](https://confluence.cask.co/display/ENG/Long+Running+Tests)

All the long running tests/test-packages should be under ``<cdap-integration-tests>/long-running-test/test/java/co/cask/cdap/longrunning``

To run all the tests under ``longrunning`` package::

  mvn clean test -P long-running-test -DinstanceUri=<cdap-host>:<cdap-port> -Dinput.state=./long-running-test-in.state -Doutput.state=./long-running-test-out.state

Here, ``-Dinput.state`` is an input file from previous run which will be used in current run.
``-Doutput.state`` is an output file which will be used to persist state of current run.

To run selected single/multiple tests under longrunning package::

  mvn clean test -P long-running-test -DinstanceUri=<cdap-host>:<cdap-port> -Dinput.state=./long-running-test-in.state -Doutput.state=./long-running-test-out.state -Dlong.test=IncrementTest,DataCleansingTest -Dlong.running.namespace=testNamespace

Here, ``-Dlong.test`` is used to specify multiple comma separated tests.
``-Dlong.running.namespace`` is used to specify namespace name for all long running tests. If not specified, 'Default' namespace will be used.
